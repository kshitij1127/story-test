once upon a time in a jungle, there was a monkey who was very happy.
the monkey used to live on trees, swinging around the branches and eating its fruits.
in the lake nearby, there resided two crocodiles, who were very cunning and arrogant.
once, the crocodile's wife decided to eat the monkey for dinner, so it told its husband, 'why don't 
we invite the monkey for dinner and eat him? ' the crocodile agreed.
according to their plan the monkey was invited for dinner. 
the monkey agreed to come on the condition that it would not be eaten. 
the crocodiles agreed but they thought they would break their promise once he gets into the lake.
the monkey did not know how to swim, so he asked the crocodile to take him on his back.
the crocodile agreed and little did he know that the monkey had also done his preparation.
as they were about to reach their home they stopped by a rock and the monkey was asked to climb on the rock.
the crocodile asked the monkey to wait for the rock as he had to bring his wife.
the monkey waited while the crocodile slowly crept behing and started waiting for the right moment
the monkey also knew that the crocodile would try to eat him. 
then when the crocodile opened his mouth from behind, the monkey was quick and as the 
crocodiles eyes were shut, he was not able to catch the monkey. the monkey escaped to freedom and never 
came near the lake again.
